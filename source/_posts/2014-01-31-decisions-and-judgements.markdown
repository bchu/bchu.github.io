title: "Decisions and Judgements"

A note to myself on simple frameworks for guiding the decisions I make and the judgments I come to.

# Decisions

Regret-minimization framework.
Optimize a single most important factor and mitigate all other tradeoffs.
Don't be distracted by irrelevant things.
Don't be afraid to take risks.

# Judgements

Refrain from judging things - people, technology, opportunities, ideas - by what they can do today, judge them by what they can do in the future.
Don't ignore things you don't immediately understand.
