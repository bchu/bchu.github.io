title: "Don't Become Proficient. Become Comfortable"
description: "When you're learning a new technology, the right goal is becoming comfortable with it, not proficient in it."
---

When you're learning something new, be it web development, mobile development, or something else, you shouldn't immediately set a goal of being proficient. Set a goal of being comfortable.

I think you're actually approaching it from the right angle. It is certainly possible, and in fact desirable, to set the goal of becoming comfortable building web applications. Notice I did not say being an expert in or even being proficient in. Being comfortable with an ecosystem is, I think, one of the biggest hurdles when you're learning new technology.

To me, comfortable means having enough basics down so that you're comfortable looking things up (looking up CSS styles, jQuery methods, JavaScript DOM methods, SQL queries, whatever lightweight backend language/frameworks you pick) and comfortable plugging libraries and frameworks together.

Again, comfortable does not mean proficient. Comfortable means being able to have an idea and, without knowing the specific language or API details, being able to find out those details on your own because you know where to look.
