A compilation of different optimizations for front-end performance.

Disclaimer: I do not claim credit for coming up or discovering any of these optimizations, the vast majority are taken from other, disparate resources.

# Page load (layout, parsing, reflow)
JS
CSS
async defer

# DOM
document fragment

# Events
debounce
listen from parent, check event.target (or jquery sugar)

# Server-side factors
301/302
caching

# Selectors
#id
caching

# General JS
caching length

# Tools
