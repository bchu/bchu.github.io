I spend plenty of time thinking about the kinds of questions most ambitious people my age do: how should I prepare for the future? What kind of career should I pursue? What's worth learning?

<!-- more -->

Most of my college friends think about their next semester, their next year, and what happens after graduation. Most of my friends in industry think about as far as their next job. This is a pretty good strategy. I don't believe in planning any further out than a couple of years, because I can never predict how things change in my life. The future is hard to predict.

But we know the world fifty years in the future is going to be unrecognizable today. We know it. Compare the 1960s to today: a total transformation. So even though you can never predict how things change in your life, you can still predict something: change is coming. Technological change, social change, and economic change. It's obvious, but we don't think about this that much. We don't usually pause in our daily lives to think about just how much different the future will be from today. I can only describe the future has having the kind of change I would perceive today as magic <a name="1-back" href="#1">[1]</a>.

To start off, here are a few simple trends I believe will play out in the intermediate and long future, but within my lifespan:

1. Life and society will be transformed several times over by advances in science and engineering. I don't have a single shred of doubt about this. I can't tell you exactly what will change, though <a name="2-back" href="#2">[2]</a>.

2. As a result of advances in medicine and environmental engineering, I will probably live beyond the age of 120.

    And there is a substantial chance I will live to some age beyond 300.

3. During my longer lifetime, the rewards of wealth and power will be increasingly reaped by those with capital - financial resources, machinery, and organizational clout - as opposed to labor <a name="3-back" href="#3">[3]</a>.

I don't believe in planning too far for the future, but I always try to keep these trends in mind.

These trends don't paint a clear picture of the best path forwards, though. The concentration of wealth in those with capital suggests entrepreneurial careers or careers in leadership. The scientific revolutions that await us suggest deep study in rapidly advancing areas - such as biotechnology, computing, or energy. And the long lifespans we will enjoy encourages taking time off - after all, we have long working lives and careers ahead of us.

### Getting even crazier...

I am much, much less convinced of these things, but I personally forsee two outcomes for humans over the next few centuries. Humanity reaches an unimaginably advanced level of technological achievement (exponential technological progress), or we end up killing ourselves off. Polar opposite outcomes.

<a name="1" href="#1-back">[1]</a> Sufficiently advanced technology.

<a name="2" href="#2-back">[2]</a> I have no idea if it's going to be artificial general intelligence or whatever else is going to be hyped tomorrow.

<a name="3" href="#3-back">[3]</a> [Income inequality in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States). If China and the United States implement European-style redistributive economic policy, this would only temporarily set back inequality.
