A few of the frameworks and factors I've encountered for thinking about the decisions I make and the judgments I make.

## Frameworks

When facing multiple priorities and opportunities that you can take, consider these ideas:

1. *The regret-minimization framework*: Ask yourself which opportunity you will regret not taking. Ask yourself if you will regret doing something. This has probably been the most influential for me. <a name="1-back" href="#1">[1]</a>.

2. *Focus on optimizing single factor and only then seek ways to mitigate the tradeoffs.* We tend to evaluate choices based on tradeoffs. For example, an engineer friend of mine was trying to decide on which company to join. He felt that joining a rapidly growing startup would maximize his potential upside (through equity), whereas joining a big tech firm would give him the opportunity to learn more, earn him more money (expected value), and boost his resume, wheras staying at his current company would increase his opportunities for internal advancement. Under this framework, he should pick the most important factor (education, salary, upside potential, advancement) to optimize, and completely ignore all other factors. This is useful because the most distracting part of making a decision is having to consider all of the tiny little tradeoffs that have to be evaluated. <a name="2-back" href="#2">[2]</a>

3. *Consider the uniqueness of an opportunity*. Are some of your opportunities ones that can only be seized now, or are they ones that you have years and years to pursue in the future. This is quite broad. For example, if you want to have kids and if one opportunity you want to pursue is a startup, you have to consider that you'll have less time when you're older.

4. *Consider comparative advantage*. Which opportunities are specific to your skills, and which are general opportunities open to all? I wrote more about this [in a previous blog post]({% post_url 2014-01-27-work-where-you-have-comparative-advantages %}).

5. *Potential is greater than what is possible right now.* Refrain from judging opportunities by what they mean today. Judge them by what they mean for the future. This is more specifically geared towards technological opportunities. For example, I don't have the highest opinion of trends like Bitcoin, but I try very hard to refrain from dismissing Bitcoin out of hand, simply because most flaws of cyptocurrencies are rooted in flaws that exist today. But those flaws might possibly be eliminated in the future.

These are just ways of thinking about decisions, not hard rules on how to act. Sometimes these frameworks don't apply. Sometimes they might even conflict!
