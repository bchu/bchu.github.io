Introducing my first iPhone game, [Devils in Heaven (app store link)](), a 2D infinite runner game with interactive obstacles!

<screenshot>

Beezlebubbly is stuck in heaven, and you need to help him escape from the not-too-happy angels chasing him. Fling statues and harps around and protect Beezlebubbly from the arrows.

It's completely free with no ads or in-app purchases, though I might add in-app purchases if the game gets popular enough.

Built with [coocs2d-iphone](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) and [Kobold2D](http://www.kobold2d.com/display/KKSITE/Home).

# The Process

Devils in Heaven was a project I worked on in short bursts, a project that I left dormant for months at a time. I started the game in June of 2012 when I interned over the summer with MakeGamesWithUs (MGWU) after high school. The internship program, which continues today, is unlike your typical paid or unpaid internship - it's more like an incubator where you work on our own game alongside the MGWU developers and other interns. Over three months I finished roughly half the game - while learning Objective-C and cocos2d.

Here's what it looked like at that point:

Afterwards, I [joined](/about) the MGWU team full-time as I took a year off. I worked on the game here and there, bringing it up to 90%, before largely shelving the project for nearly a year until the past few weeks.

The project was the first 10,000+ lines of code object-oriented program I ever worked on, and it shows itself - the code is in dire need of serious refactoring, probably a month's worth of work, if the game ever takes off.

But it works! Hope you like it!
