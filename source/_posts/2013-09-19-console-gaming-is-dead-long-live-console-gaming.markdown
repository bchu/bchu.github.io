Console gaming is dead. Long live console gaming.

When I was working at a mobile gaming startup I spent some time thinking about what might lie in the future of gaming and mobile gaming. Reading this article (it's really long) got me thinking about the decline of the console gaming ecosystem: http://www.notenoughshaders.com/2012/07/02/the-rise-of-costs-the-fall-of-gaming/. My thoughts: console gaming as we know it today is a dying segment. Casual gaming won't eat console gaming. Mobile gaming will eat console gaming. There's an important distinction - the rise of mobile gaming does not mean the death of hardcore gaming.

Mobile: a platform that more than 50% of all Americans teenagers own (and growing), a platform that is carried around nearly everywhere by most users, a platform that is expanding globally. Because of that audience, we're looking at ROIs that can outpace console games. Halo 4's dev and marketing costs are estimated to be well over $100MM. Its first weekend gross was $220MM. Halo 3's first weekend sales were roughly $170MM and Halo 3 ended up selling roughly $600MM total (10 million copies sold [1]). So based on that let's be generous and extrapolate Halo 4's total sales as $800MM. We haven't taken into account 1) eventual discounting on each unit and 2) retail markups and packaging costs. Angry Birds (the first version) cost $135k to develop. It grossed 7.35MM (after Apple's "retail" cut) [3]. Angry Birds had a ROI of 54x. Halo 4 had a (liberal) ROI of 8x. Angry Birds is an outlier, but so is Halo 4.

It's also a mistake to think that smartphones are purely for casual games. Console-quality games are already moving to the iOS/Android platforms. So-called mid-core games are very profitable on mobile. There is a trend of games charging greater and greater amounts of money, as the Final Fantasy ports do. The market most certainly does not enforce a $0.99 price point. Games with higher production values routinely push past that price point.

Bear in mind that the iPhone 5 is considerably more powerful than the Xbox, and is roughly 1/4th as powerful as the Xbox 360 on one metric (texture rendering). Given 1) exponential growth in mobile processing/graphics power, 2) the increasing delay between console launches which allows for catching up (8 years between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One), and 3) diminishing marginal returns in graphical quality when hardware quality is increased past a certain point, in 2-3 years smartphones will be capable of Xbox 360 games, and a few years after that will have caught up with next-gen consoles. This gap is narrowing even faster with tablets. The article mentions how the Wii U is comparable to an iPad 4. There are tons of startups out there building game controllers to overcome/augment the limitations of touch UIs. Mobile games are already being wirelessly hooked up to televisions/monitors.

Big budget console games won't die. Not completely. There will always be a market for the absolute bleeding edge. But I think it's clear that mobile gaming will eat up huge segments of the console market. One "type" of console that I see as a potential commercial hit would be immersive AR platforms, like the Oculus Rift. But there's no reason that mobile can't eat that too after several years.
Looking even farther into the future, I think there is great potential for other advancements in mobile such as actual physical buttons that are programmatically generated over the touchscreen [4].

Within three year iPhone and Android-phones will likely be more powerful than the Xbox 360. Give another generation and they will likely be more powerful than the PS3. They already include a broader platform to build games around (geolocation, social integration). At that point, we may well be hooking up our smartphones to a larger screen to play our "console" games.

Obviously, I don't disagree that top-end PCs and cutting edge consoles will always be more powerful than mobile devices. But just because there will always be something faster does not mean consumers won't flock to mobile from consoles. There's a reason the Xbox 360 is 7 years old. It's because the Xbox 360 was good enough for 7 years and there weren't many games that strained the Xbox 360's power (ditto for the PS3). By the time the next Xbox is released, the Xbox 360 will have had a 10 year cycle. At a certain point hardware no longer becomes the biggest limiting factor. Within a few years smartphones may have eaten everything that consoles occupy perhaps except for hyper-photorealistic more-than-1080p games. There will always be a market for consoles, but that market is shrinking at the same time that the mobile gaming market expands.
As for your second point, it's simply wrong to assume that all mobile games cost $1 and will continue to do so in the future. Part of the prevalence of $1 apps is because those apps are casual and very basic. There is no reason that higher-quality games can't charge more in the future. Final Fantasy Tactics (a PS/Game Boy Advanced/DS game) was released on the iPhone for $16. If and when smartphones rival consoles, there is nothing stopping Activision from charging $60.
