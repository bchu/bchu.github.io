I'm a software engineer hacking on my own [projects](/projects/) while studying `Computer Science` at `UC Berkeley`. This summer I'm working at `Twitter` on revenue analytics. I'm also involved as an officer at [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). Next fall I'll be a undergraduate teaching assistant for Berkeley's machine learning class.

I've recently been diving into software systems and `machine learning`, but I still love to build `iOS` mobile and `JavaScript` web applications. I'm still excited about the iOS ecosystem and the JavaScript ecosystem.

I formerly worked on iOS at `Keychain Logistics` (YC S12) - a mobile trucking logistics startup, iOS game development at `MakeGamesWithUs` (YC W12, now called MakeSchool), and JavaScript at `Hack Reactor`.
