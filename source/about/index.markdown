I'm studying Computer Science at `UC Berkeley` while hacking on my own [projects](/projects/). I'm currently an undergraduate student instructor for Berkeley's machine learning class (CS 189). I'm also involved as an officer at [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). This summer I interned at `Twitter` on the Ads Analytics Infrastructure team. 

I've recently been diving into software systems and machine learning, but I still love to build iOS mobile and JavaScript web applications. I'm still excited about the iOS ecosystem and the JavaScript ecosystem.

I formerly worked on iOS at `Keychain Logistics` (YC S12) - a mobile trucking logistics startup, and `MakeGamesWithUs` (YC W12, now called MakeSchool).
