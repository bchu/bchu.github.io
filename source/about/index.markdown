I'm a software engineer hacking on my own [projects](/projects/) while studying `Computer Science` at `UC Berkeley`. I'm also heavily involved as an officer at [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). Go H@B! 

I've recently been diving into machine learning and software systems areas, but I still love to work with `iOS` mobile and `JavaScript` web technologies. I enjoy building rich web and mobile apps. I'm still excited about the established iOS ecosystem and the emergent JavaScript ecosystem (single page apps, server-side technologies, and novel HTML5 APIs).

This summer I'll be working at Twitter. I formerly worked on iOS at `Keychain Logistics` (YC S12) - a mobile trucking logistics startup, iOS game development at `MakeGamesWithUs` (YC W12, now called MakeSchool), and JavaScript at `Hack Reactor`.
