I'm a web and mobile engineer that loves to work with `iOS` and `JavaScript`, including server-side JavaScript. I believe in building rich  web and mobile client apps. I'm really excited about iOS and the emergent JavaScript ecosystem: MV* frameworks and libraries like `AngularJS`, and `D3.js`, server-side technologies like `Node.js` and `WebSockets`, and HTML5 APIs like `WebRTC`.

I'm currently hacking on my own projects while studying `Computer Science` at `UC Berkeley`. I'm also involved as an officer at [Hackers@Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/)

I formerly worked on iOS at `Keychain Logistics` (YC S12), a mobile trucking logistics startup, and at `MakeGamesWithUs`, an iOS game startup. I've got `Objective-C` down pretty well, and work with iOS app development.
