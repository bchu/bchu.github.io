I'm studying Computer Science at `UC Berkeley` while hacking on my own [projects](/projects/). I'm currently an undergraduate student instructor for Berkeley's machine learning class (CS 189). I'm also involved as an officer at [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). This summer I interned at `Twitter` on the Ads Analytics Infrastructure team. 

I've recently been diving into software systems and machine learning, but I still keep an eye on the iOS mobile and JavaScript web ecosystems.

I formerly worked on iOS at `Keychain Logistics` (YC S12) - a mobile trucking logistics startup.
