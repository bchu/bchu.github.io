I'm a software engineer at [Cardiogram](https://cardiogr.am/). I work on a bunch of things, particularly their machine learning for detecting early signs of health conditions. I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley where I did [research](/research/) in Trevor Darrell's lab. Earlier on I also worked on my own [projects](/projects/). I also had the fortune to serve as an [undergraduate student instructor](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs189/fa15/resources/course_staff.html) for Berkeley's machine learning class (CS 189) and an officer at [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). One summer I interned at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brrrianchu) on the Ads Analytics Infrastructure team. Although I currently mostly work in machine learning, in the past I've worked on iOS and JavaScript web.
