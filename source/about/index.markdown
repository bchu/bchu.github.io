I'm a web and mobile engineer who loves to work with JavaScript on the web and iOS for mobile. I believe rich client-side apps are the future of web development. I'm really excited about the emergent JavaScript ecosystem: MV* frameworks and libraries like `AngularJS`, and `D3.js`, server-side technologies like `node.js`, `Express`, `WebSockets`, and `Meteor`, and HTML5 APIs like `WebRTC` and `IndexedDB`.

I'm currently hacking on my own products and open-source projects while studying CS at UC Berkeley.

I was formerly the Lead Developer at MakeGamesWithUs (YC W12), an iOS game publishing startup. I've got Objective-C down pretty well, and dabble in some iOS app development in addition to iOS game development.
