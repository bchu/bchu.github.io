I'm studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley while doing [research](/research/) and hacking on my own [projects](/projects/). During my time here I've had to fortune to serve as an [undergraduate student instructor](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs189/fa15/resources/course_staff.html) for Berkeley's machine learning class (CS 189) and an officer at [Hackers @ Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/). Last summer I also interned at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/brrrianchu) on the Ads Analytics Infrastructure team. 

I've recently been diving into machine learning, but I still keep an eye on the iOS mobile and JavaScript web ecosystems.
